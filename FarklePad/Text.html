<h2>
	Equipment 
</h2>
<li>6 Dice</li>
<li>1 iPad</li>
<h2>
	Number of Players 
</h2>
Anywhere between 2 (because one is just sad) and 8 players (it's a party!) may play in one game. The free version of Farkle Pad supports 2 players. You can purchase the upgrade to access up to 8 players. 
<h2>
	The Object 
</h2>
To acquire points by a systematic rolling of the dice. 
<h2>
	Preparation 
</h2>
<li>Add player names to the score board</li>
<br />
<li>Set scoring parameters: 
<ul>
	<li>Start Threshold - In order for a player to initially enter the game, (start accumulating points), the player must continue throwing dice in their turn until they either farkle or reach the point threshold where the points are then recorded. Sometimes it might take many turns before a player can get on the board.</li>
	<li>Farkle Penalty - A <b>Farkle</b> occurs when the dice are rolled and no point dice appear. At this point the player loses all point dice collected during that turn, and the play passes to the next player. No points are recorded. If a player "farkles" for three consecutive turns the typically results is a deduction of points from the player's score. This is usually -500 or -1000 but you can set this however you like.</li>
	<li>Winning score - Play is almost always to 10,000, but you can decide how long you want to play.</li>
	
</ul>
<h2>
	Playing the Game 
</h2>
<p>
	At the beginning of each turn, the player throws all of the dice at once. After each throw, one or more scoring dice must be set aside (see sections on scoring below). The player may then either end their turn and <b>"bank"</b> the score accumulated so far, or continue to throw the remaining dice. 
</p>
<p>
	If the player has scored all six dice, they have "hot dice" and <b>must</b> roll all six dice at least one more time, before stopping and keeping the points collected. There is no limit to the number of times a player may roll in one turn so long as they are accuring points each time. If none of the dice score in any given throw, the player has "farkled" and all points for that turn are lost. At the end of the player's turn, the dice are handed to the next player in succession (usually in clockwise rotation), and they have their turn. 
</p>
<h2>
	Scoring 
</h2>
<em>Using Farkle Pad makes scoring easy - just tap the dice combination that you rolled and want to score as you go. Then when you are done with your turn tap the Bank button on the top and your points will be added to the score board.</em><br><br> 

Points are acquired one of three different ways. 
<li>A roll of a 1 is worth 100 points.</li>
<li>A roll of a 5 is worth 50 points.</li>
<li>Three (3) dice rolled at the same time with the same value is worth 100 times the face value, for example: three 2’s rolled is 200 points and three 5’s rolled is 500 points.</li>
<li>One exception to this rule is that three 1’s rolled is 1,000 points rather than 100 points.</li>
<p>
	The following scores for single dice or combinations of dice are widely used, in that they are common to nearly all descriptions of farkle scoring. 
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<b>Dice combination = Score</b> 
		<li>Each 1 = 100 </li>
		<li>Each 5 = 50 </li>
		<li>Three 1s = 1000 </li>
		<li>Three 2s = 200 </li>
		<li>Three 3s = 300 </li>
		<li>Three 4s = 400 </li>
		<li>Three 5s = 500 </li>
		<li>Three pair (e.g. 1-1-4-4-6-6) is typically scored as 500, 600, 750, 1000, or 1500. (user customizable) </li>
		<li>A straight (e.g. 1-2-3-4-5-6) is typically scored as 1000, 1200, 1500, or 2500. (user customizable)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<b>Other common scoring options are:</b> if you roll 4 of a kind, your score doubles. So, it would break down like this if you were rolling Fives: 
		<li>3 Fives = 500</li>
		<li>4 Fives = 1000</li>
		<li>5 Fives = 2000</li>
		<li>6 Fives = 4000</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<b>Four, five and six of a kind are scored in one of 3 ways: </b> 
		<li><b>Adding,</b> for each additional matching die above 3 of a kind, the 3 of a kind score is added. e.g. 3-3-3 = 300, 3-3-3-3 = 300 + 300 (600), 3-3-3-3-3 = 300 + 300 + 300 (900), and 3-3-3-3-3-3 = 300 + 300 + 300 + 300 (1200).</li>
		<br />
		<li><b>Doubling,</b> for each additional matching die above 3, 4 or 5 of a kind the score is doubled. e.g. 3-3-3 = 300, 3-3-3-3 = 300 × 2 (600), 3-3-3-3-3 = 300 × 2 × 2 (1200), and 3-3-3-3-3-3 = 300 × 2 × 2 × 2 (2400) .</li>
		<br />
		<li><b>Set value,</b> 4 of a kind is scored as 1000 or 2000, 5 of a kind is scored as 2000 or 4000 and 6 of a kind is scored as 3000, 6000, or 10000 
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	<b />For example:</b><br />
	If a player throws 1-2-3-3-3-5, they could do any of the following: score three 3s as 300 and then throw the remaining three dice score the single 1 as 100 and then throw the remaining five dice score the single 5 as 50 and then throw the remaining five dice score three 3s, the single 1, and the single 5 for a total of 450 and then throw the remaining die score three 3s, the single 1, and the single 5 for a total of 450 and stop, banking 450 points in that turn This is not an exhaustive list of plays based on that throw, but it covers the most likely ones. If the player continues throwing, as in any of the above cases except the last, they risk farkling and thus losing all accumulated points. On the other hand, if they score five dice and have only one die to throw, they have a 1 in 3 chance of scoring a single 1 or a single 5, and then having scored all six dice they will have "hot dice" and can throw all six dice again to further increase their score. Each scoring combination must be achieved in a single throw. For example, if a player has already set aside two individual 1s and then throws a third with the four dice remaining, they do not have a triplet of 1s for a score of 1000 but merely three individual 1s for a score of 300. 
</p>
<h2>
	Other ways of playing: 
</h2>
<ul>
	<li>One option is if you farkle on the first roll of your turn you score 500 points.</li>
	<li>If you roll 4 of a kind, your score doubles. So if you roll 4 3’s, you get 600 rather than 300. With 5 of a kind, it doubles again. Etc. For example, if a player throws 1-2-3-3-3-5, they could do any of the following: 
	<ul>
		<li>score three 3s as 300 and then throw the remaining three dice</li>
		<li>score the single 1 as 100 and then throw the remaining five dice</li>
		<li>score the single 5 as 50 and then throw the remaining five dice</li>
		<li>score three 3s, the single 1, and the single 5 for a total of 450 and then throw the remaining die</li>
		<li>score three 3s, the single 1, and the single 5 for a total of 450 and stop, banking 450 points in that turn</li>
	</ul>
	<br />

	<h4>
		Secret Strategy: 
	</h4>
	<p>All point dice do not have to be set aside. If you roll a 1 and a 5, sometimes it may be strategic to keep the 1 and roll the 5 again with the rest of the non-point dice. This may give you a better chance of rolling a three of a kind. But, at least one point die must be set aside after each roll.</p></dir>
<h2>
	Winning 
</h2>
<p>In order to win, A player must get 10,000 points or other predefined value. We will use 10,000 for our example. Once a player has achieved a winning point total, each other player has one last turn to try to score enough points to surpass that high-score. If no-one is able to beat that score, then he or she is declared the winner. If someone beats his or her score then that new player wins the game. </p>
